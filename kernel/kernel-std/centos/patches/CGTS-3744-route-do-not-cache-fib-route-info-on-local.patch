Subject: [PATCH 03/30] CGTS-3744: route: do not cache fib route info on local
 routes with oif

For local routes that require a particular output interface we do not want to
cache the result.  Caching the result causes incorrect behaviour when there are
multiple source addresses on the interface.  The end result being that if the
intended recipient is waiting on that interface for the packet he won't receive
it because it will be delivered on the loopback interface and the IP_PKTINFO
ipi_ifindex will be set to the loopback interface as well.

This can be tested by running a program such as "dhcp_release" which attempts
to inject a packet on a particular interface so that it is received by another
program on the same board.  The receiving process should see an IP_PKTINFO
ipi_ifndex value of the source interface (e.g., eth1) instead of the loopback
interface (e.g., lo).  The packet will still appear on the loopback interface
in tcpdump but the important aspect is that the CMSG info is correct.

Sample dhcp_release command line:

   dhcp_release eth1 192.168.204.222 02:11:33:22:44:66
