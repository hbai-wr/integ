shim-signed (1.31) unstable; urgency=medium

  * update-secureboot-policy: fix error if /var/lib/dkms does not
    exist. Closes: #923718
  * Separate the helper scripts into a new shim-signed-common package,
    apart from the actual signed shim binaries so that we can
    sensibly support co-installability using Multi-Arch.
    Closes: #928486
  * Add/update translations:
    + Italian (Closes: #915993, thanks to Beatrice Torracca)

shim-signed (1.30) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Force the built-using version to be 15+1533136590.3beb971-6. That
    *does* match the source we've used, we're only using -5 due to
    toolchain changes elsewhere. Ick :-(

shim-signed (1.29) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New signed binaries available from MS for amd64, arm64 and i386
  * Change maintainer to be the EFI team
  * Update the build-depends
    + Specifically depend on sbsigntool (>= 0.9.2-2) to fix a bug in the
      PE/COFF checksum that otherwise breaks the build
  * Tweak the binary package setup a lot
    + We're now building for 3 arches
    + Depend on the right grub-efi-$arch-bin package for each arch
    + Depend on the right shim-helpers-$arch-signed package for each
      arch
    + Remove the old Replaces: and Breaks:, as we don't clash with files
      from the shim binary package any more.
  * Stop copying helper binaries into our package now
    + We just depend on shim-helpers-ARCH-signed now
  * Tweak build, don't assume amd64
  * Add lintian overrides for things we can't really change:
    + We're including pre-built binaries, as that's where our signatures
      are coming from. We have the matching source in the shim source
      package.
  * Update Standards-Version to 4.3.0 (no changes needed)

shim-signed (1.28+nmu3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * (Still) explicitly uploading from a chroot with older binaries
    installed for shim and sbsigntool, and update Build-Depends to
    point to those speficic versions. This package will *not* function
    with other versions installed.
  * Add Breaks: shim (<= 0.9+1474479173.6c180c6-1), Closes: #924100
  * +nmu2 fixed the installability problem caused by waiting for
    Microsoft's signature on the new shim packages. Closes: #922179

shim-signed (1.28+nmu2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Copy the helper binaries from the shim binary so that we no longer
    need to depend on it. See #922179 for more details. Add a Replaces:
    shim and to allow us to over-write binaries there.
  * Explicitly uploading in a chroot with older binaries installed for
    shim and sbsigntool, and update Build-Depends to point to those
    speficic versions. This package will *not* function with other
    versions installed.
